1.0b
====
  - In Query::Version, a call to SetOS will call POSIX::uname and try to get
    the OS name from there.  (Not sure if this work on Windows and Mac...)
  - Added GetAgents function to Protocol.pm to query a server/transport
    and get the list of supported agents.
  - Fixed bug in Query where the sub lists (items from roster and agents from
    agents) were not being pulled back into <query/>.
  - Fixed bug in Agent were the GetJID and SetJID were operating on the wrong
    value.
  - Fixed bug in Agents where the new agent objects were not being created
    properly.
  - Fixed bug in examples/client where it called a function from Query without
    getting the query from the iq.
  - Added function Reply to IQ and Presence objects as well.
  - Added function Reply to Message objects.  It takes a string, and based
    on that string it sets the proper values for to/from/etherx:to/etherx:from,
    thread, type, and id.

  - Updated example.pl.
  - If you have Time::Timezone installed in the Query/Time.pm automagically
    uses the timezone functions to figure out your timezone when you call
    SetTZ().

    SHA-1 digest to encrypt the password for Authorization.
  - RosterGet returns a complex data structure that contains the roster from
    the server.

    do.
