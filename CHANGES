    future in favor of the Component.pm module and Jabber Server
    Components.
  - Fixed support for the new connection profile found in the new
    Jabber server.  (You cannot use this to connect a Transport
    to a server before 1.1.2).

    part, but previously had a value in the Server would goof up.
  - Fixed bug in AuthSend where the type='set' attribute was not being
    set for the <iq/>.
  - Fixed bug where an unkown namespace in an IQ would cause an error.

1.0016

1.0013

1.0011

  - Fixed a bug where PresenceDBParse would take any presence, regardless of 
    the type.  It should only take available and unavailable.

1.0010
======
  - Fixed a bug in the GetXMLData function where it would try to check an
    attrib but the array entry it was checking did not contain an array.
    Added a ref() statement in there to fix that.

    all of the calls in Protocol to ErrorCode from ErrorType.

    Jabber version 1.0 and Net::Jabber verison 005.

1.0d
====
  - GetQuery and GetX returns undef if there is not valid namespace found.

    uses that tag as the query or x.
  - Added Jabber::X::GC to handle GroupChat X tags.

    item not being removed.

====
  - Fixed bug in Message, Presence, and IQ with the GetJID function changing.

1.0b

    and get the list of supported agents.

    value.
  - Fixed bug in Agents where the new agent objects were not being created
    properly.
  - Fixed bug in examples/client where it called a function from Query without
    getting the query from the iq.
  - Added function Reply to IQ and Presence objects as well.
  - Added function Reply to Message objects.  It takes a string, and based
    on that string it sets the proper values for to/from/etherx:to/etherx:from,
    thread, type, and id.

    uses the timezone functions to figure out your timezone when you call
    SetTZ().

    SHA-1 digest to encrypt the password for Authorization.
  - RosterGet returns a complex data structure that contains the roster from
    the server.
  - <iq/> modules now use the AUTOLOAD and delegates same as the <x/> modules 
    do.

  - Changed method of handling timeouts.

  - Added SetError and SetErrorType to IQ.pm.
  - Added support for "value" and "tree" on the root tag in the GetXMLData
