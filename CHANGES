  - Added PresenceDB functions to make managing the multiple resource and 
    priority thing much easier for a client/transport.

1.0006
======
  - Added support for <truncated/> in iq:search.

1.0005
======
  - Changed AutoUpdate namespaces to show <ver/> becoming <version/>.
  - When SeachRequest and RegisterRequest get errors they now return undef
    to show that there was an error.

1.0d
====
  - GetQuery and GetX returns undef if there is not valid namespace found.
  - Fixed bug in namespace handling.  Instead of hardcoding looking for <x/>
    and <query/> Net::Jabber now searches for any tag that has an xmlns and
    uses that tag as the query or x.
  - Added Jabber::X::GC to handle GroupChat X tags.
  - Added Debug object to make it easier to log debug information.
  - Fixed bug in JID where GetJID did not return the correct JID if there
    is an % in the UserID.
  - Added Key.pm.
  - Fixed bug in RosterRemove where the JID was not being sent and thus the
    item not being removed.

1.0c
====
  - Fixed bug in Message, Presence, and IQ with the GetJID function changing.

1.0b
====
  - Added Query::AutoUpdate.
  - In Query::Version, a call to SetOS will call POSIX::uname and try to get
    the OS name from there.  (Not sure if this work on Windows and Mac...)
  - Added GetAgents function to Protocol.pm to query a server/transport
    and get the list of supported agents.
  - Fixed bug in Query where the sub lists (items from roster and agents from
    agents) were not being pulled back into <query/>.
  - Fixed bug in Agent were the GetJID and SetJID were operating on the wrong
    value.
  - Fixed bug in Agents where the new agent objects were not being created
    properly.
  - Fixed bug in examples/client where it called a function from Query without
    getting the query from the iq.
  - Added function Reply to IQ and Presence objects as well.
  - Added function Reply to Message objects.  It takes a string, and based
    on that string it sets the proper values for to/from/etherx:to/etherx:from,
    thread, type, and id.

1.0a
====
  - Added better example files in examples/.
  - Wrote Transport.pm, it too uses Protocol.pm through delegates.

  - Moved high-level functions out of Client.pm into Protocol.pm.
  - Added support for jabber:iq:agent, jabber:iq:agents, and jabber:x:roster.
  - Updated example.pl.
  - If you have Time::Timezone installed in the Query/Time.pm automagically
    uses the timezone functions to figure out your timezone when you call
    SetTZ().
  - If you have Digest::SHA1 installed then Client.pm automagically uses the 
    SHA-1 digest to encrypt the password for Authorization.
  - RosterGet returns a complex data structure that contains the roster from
    the server.
  - <iq/> modules now use the AUTOLOAD and delegates same as the <x/> modules 
    do.
  - Bumped version to 1.0a.
  - Changed method of handling timeouts.
  - Added code to better handle errors on the Stream.  It now actually returns
    undef, or "", when the server or connection dies.

    "", if the Connect failed.

    top-level tags.

  - Added SetError and SetErrorType to IQ.pm.
  - Added support for "value" and "tree" on the root tag in the GetXMLData
    function in Jabber.pm.
