    top-level tags.

  - Added SetError and SetErrorType to IQ.pm.
  - Added support for "value" and "tree" on the root tag in the GetXMLData

======
  - Supports Jabber v0.8.1.
  - Fixed support for IQ tags.  Changed to distributed modules for each
    namespace.

    use Net::Jabber.
  - Removed <ext> support from Status since it isn't designed to handle it.
