Net::Jabber v0.8.1a

The Jabber Instant Messaging project is an Open Source project seeking
to provide a complete cross protocol messaging solution.  The problem
with current IM solutions is that they are all proprietary and cannot
talk to each other.  Jabber seeks to get rid of those barriers by
allowing a Jabber client to talk with an AOL user, or an IRC chat room,
or any number of other programs.

For more information about the Jabber project visit http://www.jabber.org.

Net::Jabber is a collection of Perl modules that provide a Perl Developer
access to the Jabber protocol.  Using OOP modules we provide a clean
interface to writing anything from a full client to a simple protocol
tester.

Support is planned for allowing Transports to be written in Perl so that
prototyping can be done before the actual program is written.
